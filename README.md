# KeePassWeb
This project is a web interface for a KeePass file.
The intended use of this project is run on an Azure WebApp which is secured by an Azure AD login (https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad)

This makes it possible to manage the KeePass file with all Azure AD users
